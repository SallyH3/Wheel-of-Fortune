# Wheel of Fortune

## Description

For a paired project at Turing School of Software & Design, we created an app where 3 players can play a game of Wheel of Fortune that functions similarly the popular TV show. 

## Setup

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Learning goals

We worked on this project in order to become more familiar with jQuery, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and WebPack.

## Linting Your Code

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look at the JavaScript files you have within the `src` directory and the `test` directory. 

## Webpack?

If you look in the `package.json` file, you'll see one of the library dependencies called `webpack`. If you're interested in learning more about what Webpack is and how it works behind the scenes, take a look through the [Webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your game_, then you can consider deploying your game to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your game to the web. Research deploying a Webpack project to GitHub Pages or ask your instructors about it if you get to that point. (Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!)
